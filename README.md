# Next It Application

## Weekly Updates

### Week 5
Last week, I planned out most of the stories I expected to complete the first 2 sprints, including application layout and ideation. I also started work on designing the home page and login page of the application.

This week, I plan to complete the design and implementation of the login page and home page of the application. I will share progress and designs next week. I am also planning to integrate a basic credentials/login system. If I were to expand into compatibility with google login, I will explain that plan and next steps.

I am much more comfortable with using IDEs like Visual Studio Code than Android Studio so I made that transition last week. However, I ran into some emulator issues so I am still cleaning those up. However, that impediment should be resolved soon.

As for how I can improve my workflow, I need to reevaluate my pointing system for the stories I am working on. I plan to re-point the stories I have planned and will plan, and divide some larger stories into smaller less daunting tasks.

### Week 4
Last week I still was in the process of learning Flutter, spending time on several tutorials and other online resources. I also started focusing more on UI/UX, downloading other similar applications and getting inspiration for design features I would like to implement, given enough time. I also set up an Agile board as mentioned before to organize my thoughts, provide time estimates, and better plan future sprints. This board is located here: https://trello.com/b/CkbVt8Hk/next-it-application-trello

This week, I plan to complete the Flutter learning period, accepting that it is not smart to try and learn everything right now. The important thing is to cover the basics. I can choose to specialize in more specific things later as things come up. I also plan to finish my first official sprint, which covers the ground work for my first application feature.

As of now, I am struggling to come up with the best approach for implementing my first feature. I don't really know where to start. To mitigate this, I am planning to jump in with a few pieces at the time. I will focus on making things look nicer later.

I am a lot more organized as compared with two weeks ago. However, I struggle staying in a good rhythm. From now on, I am planning to set aside 1-2 hours 3 times a week, blocking off this time to focus solely on this project.

### Week 3
Last week, I finished setting up my flutter environment for my application and determined what functionality I wanted to include. I also finished writing my project proposal after getting feedback on some things I could potentially include in that proposal and project as a whole. I also started making a habit of writing things down as soon as I think of new ideas or features, and then evaluating how feasible each of them could be considering the time frame.

This week, I plan to continue experimenting with the flutter environment, the libraries, and the theme of my application. From there, I will see if I need more resources to understand the application development process!

Right now, I don't have any impediments with the exception of learning a completely new language and framework. I already anticipated this by giving myself several weeks to begin implementing one feature, which includes learning this new environment. But, this could be something I need to extend.

As for what I could improve, I mentioned setting up an agile story board of tasks and effort required, which I haven't set up yet but I will next week. 

## Project Proposal

### Vision statement: how will this project expand your professional skills and knowledge?
1. I will gain hands-on experience with application development frameworks
2. I will work with APIs related to location services and learn how to retrieve real-time data from various sources
3. I will develop experience with backend services for data storage and management

### Motivation: why is this project important to you?
For one, this application is meant to solve a problem that I have almost every weekend. I like doing spontaneous things but there is usually never an organized way to do things spontaneously. I am also curious about the entire process of developing an application which isn't something offered in my undergraduate work. This will be something that I can be proud of after creating it.

### Specific and measurable goals (learning objectives) for the project. Remember that a total of 45 hours will be dedicated to the course and project over the 16 week (or 12 week summer) semester. You want to limit the scope of your project based on that time limitation.
- Week 2-3: I will complete research into the framework, APIs, data handling, and additional plugins.
- Week 4: Create a complete set of user experience sketches/designs
- Week 5-8: Create a minimum viable product that can fetch and display nearby recommendations.
- Week 9: Bug testing and refine UI
- Week 10-11: Implement other features related to user data and credentials
- Week 12: Implement feature related to friend groups and social networking
- Week 13+: Extend as necessary previous sprints or investigate other features

### Risks to project completion, possibly including:
- I will need to learn a new framework
- No prior experience with APIs
- Financial limitations in utilizing some APIs or libraries
- Poor time estimation due to beginner knowledge

#### Mitigation Strategy for the risks listed above
- Utilize tutorials and documentation to becomes familiar with new softwares
- Utilize open source softwares along with free tiers of APIs or plugins
- Consult the CSPB community with certain roadblocks

### Project Assessments/Evaluation Criteria:
- Application is functional across both Android and iOS
- Primary feature of event/restaurant recommendation is implemented and tested
- Secondary features of social network, user data, etc. are implemented
- Up-to-date project repository and all documentation complete
- Plan for future updates in place
